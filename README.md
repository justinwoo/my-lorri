# my lorri

my non-portable (64bit linux only) lorri installation, based off some bullshit build i did.

don't take my word for it, you can go build lorri yourself: <https://github.com/target/lorri>

## Installation issues

Please note that you will need to run the lorri repo nix-shell once, in order to have some runtime dependencies for lorri installed. This may be fixed in a future release of lorri.

## Usage

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:

import (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
  owner = "justinwoo";
  repo = "my-lorri";
  rev = "350a43902265a6b1bf7da5b057d07f6246b53555";
  sha256 = "031rdy8ayarvfbh6qwqa0wppciiaa3zb12298b5768gzbyqvsjba";
}) {
  inherit pkgs;
}
```

Note: you probably want to update the rev used.
